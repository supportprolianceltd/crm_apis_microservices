Document Management API Documentation
Overview
The Document Management API provides endpoints for creating, updating, retrieving, and acknowledging documents within a multi-tenant system. It includes version control to retain and label previous document versions when updates are made, ensuring old files remain accessible.
Key Components
Models

Document: Stores the latest document metadata, including title, file_url, file_path, file_type, file_size, version, tenant_id, uploaded_by_id, updated_by_id, uploaded_at, updated_at, expiring_date, status, and document_number.
DocumentVersion: Stores version-specific data for each document, including version, file_url, file_path, file_type, file_size, created_at, and created_by_id. Linked to Document via a foreign key.
DocumentAcknowledgment: Tracks user acknowledgments of documents, including document, user, tenant, and acknowledged_at.

Serializers

DocumentSerializer: Handles serialization for Document, including file validation (PDF/image, <10MB), tenant validation, and user metadata fetching from an external auth service. Manages creation and updates with version control.
DocumentVersionSerializer: Serializes DocumentVersion records, including created_by user details.
DocumentAcknowledgmentSerializer: Serializes acknowledgment data, ensuring tenant and user validation.

Views

DocumentListCreateView: Handles GET (list documents) and POST (create new document) requests.
DocumentDetailView: Handles GET (retrieve document), PATCH (update document), and DELETE (delete document) requests.
DocumentVersionListView: Handles GET requests to retrieve all versions of a document.
DocumentAcknowledgeView: Handles POST requests to acknowledge a document.

Endpoints
1. List/Create Documents

URL: /documents/
Methods:
GET: Lists all documents for the authenticated tenant.
POST: Creates a new document with an uploaded file.


Permissions: Requires IsAuthenticated and IsAdminUser.
Behavior:
Creates a new Document with version=1.
Uploads file to storage with _v1 appended (e.g., policy_v1.pdf).
Creates a corresponding DocumentVersion record.


Response:
GET: 200 OK with list of documents.
POST: 201 Created with document data, or 400 Bad Request for validation errors.



2. Document Details

URL: /documents/<id>/
Methods:
GET: Retrieves a specific document.
PATCH: Updates a document, optionally replacing the file.
DELETE: Deletes a document.


Permissions: Requires IsAuthenticated and IsAdminUser.
Behavior (PATCH):
Saves current file details to a new DocumentVersion record.
Increments version and uploads new file with _v<version> (e.g., policy_v2.pdf).
Updates Document with new file details and creates a new DocumentVersion.


Response:
GET: 200 OK with document data.
PATCH: 200 OK with updated document data.
DELETE: 204 No Content.



3. List Document Versions

URL: /documents/<document_id>/versions/
Method: GET
Permissions: Requires IsAuthenticated and IsAdminUser.
Behavior: Retrieves all DocumentVersion records for a document, including file URLs and version numbers.
Response: 200 OK with list of versions (e.g., [{version: 1, file_url: ".../policy_v1.pdf"}, {version: 2, file_url: ".../policy_v2.pdf"}]).

4. Acknowledge Document

URL: /documents/<document_id>/acknowledge/
Method: POST
Permissions: Requires IsAuthenticated.
Behavior: Creates a DocumentAcknowledgment record if the user hasnâ€™t acknowledged the document.
Response: 201 Created with acknowledgment data, or 400 Bad Request if already acknowledged.

Version Control

Creation: New documents start with version=1. A DocumentVersion record is created with the file details.
Update: When updating with a new file:
The current file is saved as a DocumentVersion with the current version.
The version is incremented.
The new file is uploaded with _v<version> in the name.
A new DocumentVersion record is created for the updated file.


Retrieval: Use /documents/<document_id>/versions/ to access all versions, each labeled with its version number and file URL.

Notes

File Storage: Files are stored with versioned names (e.g., policy_v1.pdf, policy_v2.pdf) to ensure old versions remain accessible. No automatic deletion of old files occurs.
Acknowledgments: Updates to documents may require re-acknowledgment by users (not implemented in current code).
Database: Ensure migrations are applied for the DocumentVersion model. Index DocumentVersion.document and DocumentVersion.version for performance.
Storage Costs: Retaining all versions increases storage usage. Consider cleanup policies for old versions if needed.
