## 1. Data Security & Encryption

### Encryption at Rest:
- **Database Volumes and Backups:** The auth-service uses PostgreSQL as the primary database. PostgreSQL supports AES-256 encryption at the database level through configuration options such as `pgcrypto` extension for column-level encryption and Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) if configured at the infrastructure level. However, the current codebase does not explicitly enforce AES-256 encryption for all database volumes and backups. Private RSA keys for JWT signing are stored in the database but are not encrypted (see Security Vulnerabilities Analysis for details). We recommend implementing database-level encryption and encrypting sensitive data before storage.

### Encryption in Transit:
- **Data Transmission:** All API endpoints are served over HTTPS/TLS. The service is configured with CORS and security headers, but the exact TLS version (1.2 or higher) depends on the server configuration (e.g., Gunicorn with SSL). In development, TLS is not enforced, but production deployments should use TLS 1.2+. Data between client and server is encrypted via HTTPS.

### Key Management:
- **Customer-Managed Keys (CMK) vs. Provider-Managed:** RSA key pairs for JWT signing are generated and managed within the application (stored in the `RSAKeyPair` model). Keys are not customer-managed; they are generated by the system and stored in the database. For production, we recommend integrating with a Hardware Security Module (HSM) or cloud KMS (e.g., AWS KMS) for CMK support. Private keys are currently unencrypted in the database, posing a risk if the database is compromised.

## 2. Access Control (SOC 2 & HIPAA)

### MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication):
- **Native Support:** Yes, the platform natively supports MFA for all user roles, including API/Service accounts. MFA is implemented using TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) via the `pyotp` library. Users can enable/disable MFA through dedicated endpoints (`/api/user/2fa/setup/`, `/api/user/2fa/enable/`, `/api/user/2fa/disable/`). Backup codes are also provided. MFA is enforced during login if enabled.

### Session Management:
- **Automatic Termination:** Sessions are managed via JWT tokens with configurable lifetimes (access token: 120 minutes, refresh token: 1 day). However, there is no explicit inactivity timeout beyond token expiry. The service does not automatically terminate sessions after a specific period of inactivity (e.g., 15 minutes) without user interaction. We recommend implementing session timeout logic in the frontend or adding middleware for inactivity checks.

### Role-Based Access (RBAC):
- **Field-Level Restrictions:** Access is restricted based on user roles (e.g., 'super-admin', 'admin', 'hr', 'staff'). Permissions are defined at the model level (e.g., `permission_levels` in `CustomUser`). However, field-level masking (e.g., hiding specific PII/PHI fields) is not natively implemented. Access control is role-based but not granular at the field level. Custom permissions can be added via the `BranchRestrictedPermission` class, but full field-level RBAC requires additional development.

## 3. Data Privacy & Sovereignty (GDPR & NDPA)

### Data Residency:
- **Hosting Guarantee:** The system uses multi-tenant architecture with PostgreSQL schemas for data isolation. Data residency depends on the cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure). We cannot guarantee hosting in a specific region (e.g., Nigeria or EU) without infrastructure configuration. For compliance, deploy in the required region and configure the database accordingly. The service supports tenant-specific schemas, ensuring logical separation.

### Data Subject Rights:
- **Right to Erasure and Data Portability:** The service does not have automated processes for "Right to Erasure" or "Data Portability." User data is stored in models like `CustomUser`, `UserProfile`, and `UserActivity`. Erasure would require manual deletion or anonymization scripts. Data portability is not implemented; users cannot export their data in structured formats (e.g., JSON/CSV) automatically. We recommend developing workflows for these rights, including API endpoints for data export and deletion.

### Log Integrity:
- **Immutable Audit Logs:** User activities are logged in the `UserActivity` model, capturing actions like logins, profile updates, and data exports. Logs include timestamps, IP addresses, user agents, and success status. However, logs are stored in the database and are not immutable (can be modified by admins). For true immutability, integrate with an external logging system (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, ELK Stack) or use blockchain-based logging. Current logs are not tamper-proof.

## 4. Certifications & Legal

### Audit Reports:
- **SOC 2 Type II Report:** We do not currently have a SOC 2 Type II report. The service is in development, and security audits have not been conducted. We plan to pursue SOC 2 certification in Q2 2026. A Security Vulnerabilities Analysis document is available, highlighting current issues.

### Agreements:
- **Business Associate Agreement (BAA) for HIPAA:** We are willing to sign a BAA for HIPAA compliance.  
- **Data Processing Agreement (DPA) for GDPR/NDPA:** We are willing to sign a DPA for GDPR and NDPA compliance.

### Sub-processors:
- **Third-Party Sub-processors:** The service relies on:  
  - PostgreSQL (database)  
  - Redis (caching)  
  - Kafka (event streaming)  
  - Supabase (file storage, if enabled)  
  - Email providers (e.g., SMTP servers)  
  - Cloud infrastructure providers (e.g., AWS, DigitalOcean)  
  A full list will be provided upon request, including data processing details.

## Additional Notes

- **Compliance Gaps:** The service implements basic security features (JWT, MFA, RBAC, logging) but lacks advanced compliance controls like automated data subject rights, immutable logs, and guaranteed data residency. Refer to the Security Vulnerabilities Analysis for detailed issues.
- **Implementation Recommendations:** Follow the Appendix 1 guidelines. For Phase 2, enhance encryption and access controls. For Phase 3, add data portability and erasure workflows.
- **Supporting Documents:** Security Whitepaper (Security Vulnerabilities Analysis.md), Implementation Guide (implementations.md), and README.md are attached/included.

We appreciate the opportunity to address these requirements and are committed to achieving full compliance. Please contact us for further discussions or demonstrations.
